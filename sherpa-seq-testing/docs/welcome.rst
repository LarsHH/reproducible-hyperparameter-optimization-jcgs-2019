Welcome!
--------

SHERPA is a Python library for hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models.

It provides:

* hyperparameter optimization for machine learning researchers
* a choice of hyperparameter optimization algorithms
* parallel computation that can be fitted to the user's needs
* a live dashboard for the exploratory analysis of results.

Its goal is to provide a platform in which recent hyperparameter optimization
algorithms can be used interchangeably while running on a laptop or a cluster.
